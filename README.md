# JobCrawler
This JobCrawler crawls through one of the biggest job plattforms for Germany, namely indeed.com. By crawling through the plattform on a regular base and collecting informations like job titles, publishing date, location, company, (length of) job description etc. of every job ad, some of the following questions should be answered: Which jobs are how much in demand? Which companies from which industry have the highest demand? How does the demand develop over the course of time? Which jobs are how much in demand in different locations? etc.
