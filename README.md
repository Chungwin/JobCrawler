# JobCrawler
This JobCrawler crawls through one of the biggest job plattforms for Germany, namely indeed.com. By crawling through the plattform on a regular base and collecting informations like job titles, publishing date, location, company, (length of) job description etc. of every job ad, some of the following questions should be answered: 

Which jobs are how much in demand?<br>
Which companies from which industry have the highest demand? <br>
How does the demand develop over the course of time? <br>
Which jobs are how much in demand in different locations? <br>
...<br>
etc. <br>
<br>
I use the Python Library BeautifulSoup for pulling data out of HTML. <br>
Work in prgresss! <br> <br>
Next: <br>
- Clean 'Date column'<br>
- Reliably and repeatedly store 30K trext files in directories <br>
- Deploy on AWS or Digital Ocean .. <br>
- Let code run over (at least) a couple of monnths ..
